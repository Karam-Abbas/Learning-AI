(Verse 1 - Sung by a narrator, maybe a news anchor voice)
In the world of Pakistani cricket, tensions run high
A drama unfolds, beneath the bright sky
Hassaan Baig and Masud, two names in the fray
A feud ignited, what can we say?
From boardroom to field, the rumors take flight
A clash of opinions, a power struggle fight
The fans are all watching, with bated breath held
As the story unravels, a tale to be tell'd.

(Chorus)
Oh, Hassaan and Masud, a battle untold
A story of ambition, brave and bold
The cricket world watches, with eager eyes keen
To see how this drama will play out, on the screen.

(Verse 2 - Sung by a character representing Hassaan Baig)
I've given my all, for the team and the game
Driven by passion, fueled by the flame
I've got what it takes, to lead and to win
But some try to hold me, within and within.
He questions my methods, my vision, my call
He's undermining my efforts, determined to stall
This progress we're making, this winning we crave
He's jealous, I reckon, the power I save.

(Verse 3 - Sung by a character representing Masud)
The youngsters today, they lack the respect
For experience and wisdom, they haven't yet checked
He's reckless and brash, a danger, I fear
Putting personal glory, above what is clear.
My only intention is to safeguard the game
To ensure that the ethics, remain the same
His ambition's blinding, he cannot see straight
He'll lead us to ruin, and seal our sad fate.

(Chorus)
Oh, Hassaan and Masud, a battle untold
A story of ambition, brave and bold
The cricket world watches, with eager eyes keen
To see how this drama will play out, on the screen.

(Bridge - Narrator)
The whispers are spreading, the camps take their sides
The pressure is mounting, where truth often hides
Will bridges be mended, or will they just burn?
The future of cricket, hangs on this turn.

(Verse 4 - Sung by both characters together, overlapping and argumentative)
**Hassaan:** He's blocking my path, with his outdated ways!
**Masud:** He's risking it all, in this reckless haze!
**Hassaan:** I'm bringing innovation, a fresh winning streak!
**Masud:** He's ignoring the lessons, the history speaks!
**Hassaan:** He's stuck in the past, afraid to advance!
**Masud:** He's destroying the legacy, a dangerous chance!

(Chorus)
Oh, Hassaan and Masud, a battle untold
A story of ambition, brave and bold
The cricket world watches, with eager eyes keen
To see how this drama will play out, on the screen.

(Outro - Narrator)
The game goes on, the wickets keep falling
Who will prevail? The fans are all calling
For unity, for peace, for the good of the game
But the feud of Hassaan and Masud, will forever remain...
...A tale of two rivals, locked in a fight
Under the Pakistani cricket's ever-bright light.
