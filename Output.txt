The flickering fluorescent lights of Maisum Abbas's tiny dorm room in NASTP university seemed to mock him. Hours bled into each other, marked only by the dwindling charge on his phone and the growing mountain of empty energy drink cans beside his keyboard. He was stuck. Utterly, hopelessly, infuriatingly stuck.

Maisum, a bright-eyed second-semester student, had envisioned himself as a coding prodigy, the next Zuckerberg emerging from the hallowed halls of NASTP. His project, a revolutionary social media app connecting students based on shared study habits, was his ticket to that future. But tonight, that future was on fire – metaphorically, at least.

For three agonizing hours, Maisum had battled a particularly nasty bug. The app crashed every time a user tried to upload an image. He’d scoured Stack Overflow, consulted the cryptic error messages, and even tried yelling at the screen (a surprisingly common practice among frustrated programmers, he'd learned). Nothing worked.

Each failed attempt chipped away at his initial optimism, replacing it with a gnawing frustration. His jaw tightened, his fingers drummed a frantic rhythm on the desk, and a knot formed in his stomach. He re-read the same lines of code, a dizzying, nonsensical jumble of symbols that mocked his understanding.

He’d started the evening confident, a little cocky even. Now, he felt like a complete fraud. Was he even cut out for this? Maybe he should just drop out and become a… a plumber. At least plumbing problems had predictable solutions.

He slammed his fist on the desk, rattling the monitor and sending a cascade of empty cans clattering to the floor. “Ugh!” he groaned, burying his face in his hands. The screen glared back at him, the cursed error message blinking mockingly.

He looked around the room. The cramped space, usually a sanctuary of focused work, now felt like a cage. The half-finished code, once a source of pride, now felt like a personal affront. He felt a surge of anger, hot and irrational.

It was a moment of pure, unadulterated frustration. Years of pent-up stress from deadlines, exams, and the relentless pressure to succeed seemed to coalesce into a single, destructive urge. He felt a primal scream building inside him.

He looked at the computer, the blinking cursor, the glowing screen, the physical manifestation of his failure. And that's when the absurd thought flickered in his mind. A thought so outlandish, so impulsive, that for a fleeting second, he considered it seriously.

He imagined the satisfaction of watching the screen melt, the components crackle, the code… gone. Just… gone.

But then, the rational part of his brain, the part that was supposed to be coding a complex social media app, kicked in. He imagined the consequences: expulsion from the university, a hefty fine, and the embarrassing explanation to his parents. The fleeting urge quickly vanished.

Instead of reaching for a lighter (which he didn’t even own), Maisum took a deep breath. He stood up, stretched his aching muscles, and walked to the window. He looked out at the sprawling campus, the lights twinkling in the distance. He wasn't the only one struggling. Every student out there was facing their own challenges, their own moments of frustration.

He grabbed his jacket and walked out of the room. He needed air, he needed perspective, and he desperately needed a break. He headed to the campus cafeteria, hoping to find a familiar face and maybe, just maybe, a fresh cup of coffee and a new approach to his image uploading problem.

He left the cursed computer behind, blinking innocently in the empty room. The fire in his heart had subsided, replaced by a weary resignation. He’d come back to it. He always did. He was a programmer, after all. And programmers, even frustrated ones, never truly give up. They just take a break. Maybe. Hopefully. Before they do something they really regret. And besides, he had a backup on GitHub. Thank goodness for version control.
